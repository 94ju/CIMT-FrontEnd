## Getting started

* Make sure you have the [Angular CLI: 8.3.5](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli#installation) installed globally. 
* We use `npm` to manage the dependencies (Node: 10.16.3). 
* Then run `npm install` to resolve all dependencies (might take a minute).
### Development server
* Run `ng serve` for a dev server. 
* Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. 
* The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

### Building the project
* Run `ng build` to build the project.
* The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. 
* Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.


## Further help

To get more help on the Angular CLI use `ng help` or go check out the [Angular CLI README](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/master/README.md).
